# GDG LAGOS GIT EVENT
[https://plus.google.com/events/c60h8l7f6sn6fcm3r75dh4qshmg]

These are the slides for the  Introduction to Google App Engine  slide for the "GDG Get With Git" event held on the 24th May at the CCHUB in Lagos, Nigeria.

## Setup
To set this up on your system, just run:

```git clone http://github.com/dftaiwo/gae-ptd.git```

The above command will give you a local copy of the project checked out to a directory in your system.

#### Note:
you should have git installed and working for this to work; you could just alternatively download the zip archive of the project.

## Installation
Just open the index.html with a browser and it should work fine.

## Dependencies
- [reveal.js](http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) slideshow library.

If you want to have the repo installed with Grunt will also need to have grunt.js [installed](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#installation) to build and run it from ( http://localhost:8000/ ) in your browser of choice ( any recent browser will do ) as the library uses some CSS 3 mojo and should render properly on recent browsers.
